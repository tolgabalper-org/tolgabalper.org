Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken<br>
in Washington on May 18. This is the first highest governmental level meeting between the two<br>
countries since Joe Biden won presidential elections in January 2021.<br>
<br>
According to Çavuşoğlu's speech to reporters after a meeting at NATO in Brussels, "He received<br>
an invitation from Blinken for the talks planned for May 18. The meeting comes as the dialog<br>
between the two allies gained serious momentum in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.<br>
<br>
Turkey and the U.S. have launched what they call "Strategic Mechanism," a format<br>
that brings different institutions of the two sides together for a more comprehensive and<br>
holistic review of ties.<br>
<br>
“Anthony Blinken has invited me to Washington on May 18 to hold the [Strategic<br>
Mechanism] meeting at the level of foreign ministers. We will discuss this issue [Turkey’s<br>
demand for buying F-16s] at this meeting. We want this mechanism to be goal-oriented<br>
and fruitful,” he said.<br>
<br>
Turkey and the U.S. are negotiating over the former’s demand of purchasing 40 new F-16 <br>
fighter jets and 80 modernization kits for its existing fleets. A letter sent to the Congress by<br>
the State Department expressed the administration’s positive approach toward the sale,<br>
although a congressional approval is required. But some 53 congressmen didn't want to give positive<br>
approach due to Turkey's deployment of Russian S-400s.<br>
<br>
“The letter sent to the Congress is important and positive,” Çavuşoğlu told reporters. He<br>
recalled that there are problematic areas in ties with the U.S., including the S-400s and<br>
Washington’s continued support to the YPG in northeastern Syria.<br>
<br>
The minister also informed about his talks with his NATO counterparts, stressing that all<br>
the allied countries were praising the role Turkey has been playing since the start of <br>
Russia’s attack on Ukraine.<br>
<br>
“We observe a serious attitude change [toward Turkey]. They emphasize they know<br>
the importance of Turkey. Some countries had already taken steps in a bid to ease restrictions<br>
in the field of the defense industry. Countries such as Canada also said they want to take<br>
steps accordingly,” he said.<br>
<br>
Çavuşoğlu, however, said the importance of Turkey should not be recognized only when<br>
the European security is in danger. “Turkey is contributing to the European security at all<br>
times,” he said.<br>
<br>
The minister also said Turkey would continue its efforts for a ceasefire in Ukraine,<br>
although the recent massacre in Bucha province of Ukraine has cast a shadow on the<br>
negotiations.<br>
